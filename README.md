# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This project consists in creating a calendar application that can allow the user to save their tasks and events for each hour given (9am-5pm). The calendar gives you the current date and time, and also knows the current time the user is logging in, which gives the user an color-coded past, present and future task/event boxes.


## User Story


"AS AN employee with a busy schedule

I WANT to add important events to a daily planner

SO THAT I can manage my time effectively"


## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours of 9am&ndash;5pm
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
